# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being patient** with newcomers and those learning
- **Celebrating others' successes** and contributions

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-focused requests
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Repeatedly arguing in bad faith or with inflammatory rhetoric
- Sustained disruption of community spaces or discussions

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Participating in project-related discussions on GitHub, Discord, or other platforms

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at:

- **GitHub Issues**: For public, non-sensitive reports
- **Email**: [Your email] (for private reports)
- **Direct Message**: Contact @dronefreak on GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames, real names) of those involved
- Your account of what occurred, including:
  - When and where it happened
  - Context surrounding the incident
  - Whether the incident is ongoing
- Any relevant links (GitHub issues, comments, etc.)
- Any other information you believe is relevant

### Confidentiality

Project maintainers will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. We may publicly discuss the details of resolved incidents, but only with the reporter's explicit consent, and never with identifying information.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## When We Disagree

Disagreements, both technical and interpersonal, are inevitable. The goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views, but to resolve them constructively.

### Healthy Disagreement Looks Like:

- **Assuming good faith**: Start from the assumption that others are doing their best with good intentions
- **Being respectful**: Even when you disagree strongly, remain courteous
- **Focusing on ideas, not people**: Critique the work, not the person
- **Being open to being wrong**: Listen to understand, not just to respond
- **Seeking to understand first**: Ask clarifying questions before jumping to conclusions
- **Knowing when to step away**: If a discussion becomes heated, take a break

### Unhealthy Disagreement Looks Like:

- Personal attacks or ad hominem arguments
- Assuming bad faith or malicious intent
- Repeatedly arguing the same point without new information
- Dismissing others' perspectives without consideration
- Making the discussion about "winning" rather than finding the best solution

## Technical Disagreements

For technical disagreements:

1. **Open an Issue**: Document the problem and proposed solutions
2. **Provide context**: Share your reasoning and any relevant data/benchmarks
3. **Listen to feedback**: Consider alternative approaches
4. **Seek consensus**: Try to find a solution that addresses concerns
5. **Accept decisions**: Once a decision is made, move forward constructively

If consensus can't be reached, project maintainers will make the final decision based on what's best for the project and community.

## Community Values

### Collaboration Over Competition

We build together. Share knowledge, help others succeed, and celebrate collective achievements.

### Quality Over Speed

Take time to write good code, thorough documentation, and thoughtful reviews. Rushing leads to technical debt and frustration.

### Clarity Over Cleverness

Write code and documentation that others can understand. Clever tricks are less valuable than clear, maintainable solutions.

### Learning and Growth

Everyone is here to learn. Mistakes are learning opportunities. Help others grow, and be open to growing yourself.

### Respect for Time

- Be concise in communications
- Come prepared to discussions
- Respect others' availability and time zones
- Don't expect instant responses

## Specific Guidelines

### For Code Reviews

- **Be kind and constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person
- **Explain your reasoning**: Don't just say "this is wrong," explain why and suggest improvements
- **Ask questions**: "What do you think about...?" instead of "This is wrong"
- **Recognize good work**: Call out clever solutions and improvements
- **Be timely**: Review PRs in a reasonable timeframe

### For Issue Discussions

- **Search first**: Check if the issue already exists
- **Provide context**: Include version numbers, environment details, error messages
- **Be patient**: Maintainers may not respond immediately
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on the issue at hand
- **Update when resolved**: Share what worked so others can learn

### For Pull Requests

- **Follow contribution guidelines**: See CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Write clear descriptions**: Explain what, why, and how
- **Be responsive**: Address review feedback promptly
- **Accept decisions**: If a PR isn't accepted, understand the reasoning and move on gracefully

## Mentorship and Learning

We encourage experienced contributors to mentor newcomers:

- Answer questions patiently, even basic ones
- Point to documentation and resources
- Share your knowledge through blog posts, talks, or examples
- Provide constructive code review feedback
- Encourage experimentation and learning

For newcomers:

- Don't be afraid to ask questions (but search first!)
- Start small - fix typos, improve docs, tackle "good first issue" tags
- Learn from code reviews - they're teaching opportunities
- Be patient with yourself - everyone was new once

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I see a Code of Conduct violation?

Report it following the Enforcement section above. Don't engage in a public argument - let maintainers handle it.

### What if I'm unsure if something violates the Code of Conduct?

When in doubt, reach out to maintainers privately. It's better to ask than to let something escalate.

### What if I disagree with an enforcement decision?

You can appeal by contacting project maintainers with additional context. Decisions will be reconsidered in good faith.

### How do I report a maintainer?

If the issue involves a maintainer, contact a different maintainer or use an alternate reporting method (email vs. GitHub).

### Does this apply to private communications?

The Code of Conduct primarily applies to project spaces, but harassment in any form related to the project may be addressed.
